## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the useDebouncedSearch hook:

```bash
import React from 'react';
import { useDebouncedSearch } from 'debounced-search-hook';

const SearchComponent = () => {
  const handleSearch = (value) => {
    // Perform search operation
    console.log('Searching for:', value);
  };

  const { debouncedSearch, isTyping } = useDebouncedSearch(handleSearch, { delay: 200 });

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        placeholder="Search..." 
        onChange={(e) => debouncedSearch(e.target.value)} 
      />
      {isTyping && <p>Typing...</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default SearchComponent;
```

## API

```bash
useDebouncedSearch(onSearch, options?)
```

## Parameters

- onSearch

## Returns
An object with the following properties:
